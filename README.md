# x-challenge
This project was a 20 minute test to see whether I could complete 'The X challenge' in 20 minutes.

The x-challenge is where a program takes an input and out puts an X with the same number of rows and columns as the input.
For example:

An input of 3 would give:
'''
X X
 X
X X
'''


An input of 5 would give:
X   X
 X X
  X
 X X
X   X
